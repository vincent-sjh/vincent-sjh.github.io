- # Jianhao Song  宋建昊
- ### Hi there 👋！ Great to see you!

  - 🏫  I am a senior undergraduate student from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) majoring in [Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
  - 💻  I work on C / C++ / Python / Markdown/Django/Sanic/HTML.
- ### Self Introduction 
I'm a hacker and creator.I love the act of creating something new, much like painting. I am not content to learn and imitate the knowledge and skills that already exist, but crazy about creating something new, which echoes what Greek philosopher Socrates said 2500 years ago, "Education is a kindling of a flame, not a filling of a vessel". My computer is like my paintbrush, and I paint the world with my color. Coding is a way for me to express myself, connect, and resonate with others.
